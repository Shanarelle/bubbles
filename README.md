This is to keep track of the state of the penguin herding game



Current State
-------------
- have some chicks and sitter on screen
- chicks wander about the screen - properly bounded by canvas
- chicks and sitter have portraits



Next Steps
----------
- get chicks to react to proximity of the sitter
- allow sitter to move diagonally
- put in a pen
- add check for penned to chick so once its inside the pen it stays within its confines

- create and add music
- add animation to sitter so it flaps it arms when near a chick?
- create pen tiles so not just a line
- create background image?
