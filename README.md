This is to keep track of the state of the proc-gen bubbles game



Current State
-------------
- have our fella
	- squishes as he moves
	- good colour
	- has eyes
- can pause the game using p
- have bubbles that drift away and pop
- get fella to generate bubbles as he moves
- make bubbles disperse instead of all going the same way



Next Steps
----------
- make bubbles react to presence of fella
- make bubbles interact with each other & possibly obey wake type rules

- constrain fella to screen

- create and add music
